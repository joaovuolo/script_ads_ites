# script_ads_ites

This script is an example for the exercise session 2 of the subject IT and Society to demonstrate how thir-party cookies work. The script adds images and cookies that extract information about the user, in order to simulate the use of Google AdSense. 

Google AdSense is an advertising program offered by Google that allows website owners to monetize their online content. It enables publishers (website owners or creators) to display targeted advertisements on their websites and earn revenue based on the number of ad impressions or clicks generated. Google AdSense can also put cookies in the website, so Google is able to extract information about the users activity there.
